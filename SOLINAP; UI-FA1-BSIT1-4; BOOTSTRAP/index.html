                <p class="text-dark">Tulips are the most colorful of all spring flowers. They are also one of the easiest flowers you'll ever grow. Just plant the bulbs in fall for blossoms the following spring. There are hundreds of beautiful tulips to choose from, in enough colors, shapes, sizes and bloom times to inspire every gardener's creativity.</p>

In the 1500s, Queen Elizabeth even banned everyone except members of the royal family to wear purple as it was such a special colour! Purple tulips are perfect for bridal bouquets or to give someone who you think is totally fabulous and deserving of these beautiful blooms.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The man, the myth, the legend — yup, we’re talking about blue tulips! What makes tulips truly unique is that they are one of the few flowers that come in virtually every color. But, surprisingly, “true blue” is one of the few colors that has remained absent from tulip’s impressive color palette. Recently, a couple of clever plant breeders were able to create some of the first blue tulips. Because they are one of a kind, blue tulips represent individuality and uniqueness.</p>
